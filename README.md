# **README**

This project centeres around the classification of genetic data. 
The project includes an extensive exploration and preprocessing phase of RNA seq data, followed by the training of multiple classifiers using hyperparameter tuning. 
The initial stages of data exploration and preparation were carried out using a Jupyter notebook on VS code. Model evaluation was based on the accuracy scores of both the basic data and the metadata.


**This repo include:**
1. Jupyter notebook- All Answers apear in the jupyter notebook
2. requetment.txt - this file contain all pachges and more that I use to. (I work with poetry and vs code)
3. test_classifier.py - is the unitest file.
